            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>What if we explored the life of a Disney princess from a new lens?
                 This was our vision as we developed our performance and chose to turn a Disney princess into an Instagram influencer.
                 We would present a series of choices to our classmates,
                 who would respond to polls on our princess's Instagram account.
                 Thus, while we would have a general outline for our puppets' actions, our audience would be directing the performance.

            <h2>Puppet Assembly</h2>
            <h3>Cinderella</h3>
            <p>To achieve our idea, we needed a variety of physical puppets.
                    We planned for two Cinderella puppets: one servant version, and one princess version.
                    We used toilet paper rolls as the bodies, styrofoam balls as the heads, and wooden dowels as the rods (our control mechanism).
                    Other supplies include cloth for dresses and yarn for hair.

            <h3>Supporting Characters</h3>
            <p>We built 2D puppets out of construction paper for our supporting characters.
                 This decision was not only based on time and resource constraints,
                 but had performance implications as well. The center of attention in our performance is Cinderella
                 and the way she allows her Instagram followers to control her, rather than simply basing her decisions on what's happening around her.
                 Thus, it is appropriate that the people (and animals) around her should shrink in importance, allowing her Instagram to have a larger presence.

            <h3>Instagram</h3>
            <p>In the weeks leading up to our performance, we built a digital identity for our Cinderella
                 including stories and posts.

            <h3>Performance Slide Deck</h3>
            <p>We created a flexible slide deck with images, text, and music to support our performance.
                 This is our way of creatively engaging with the design challenge.
                 For one, we avoided voice acting given that none of us had voice acting experience.
                 Two, our audience would be directing the story.
                 So, we made our performance into a silent film. We advanced through images interspersed with
                 text that would give context to the story. Which text got displayed was determined based on the results of the Instagram polls.
                 Each slide also had different music that matched the tone of the scene.
                 We incorporated a "menu" slide where we clicked a symbol based on the poll results, pulling up the correct slide. 
                 Additionally, Cinderella's Instagram profile picture appeared in the corner of each slide when it was time for our audience to vote again.
